Conclusion
Based on the comparison, PureCounterComponent is likely to perform better than SimpleCounterComponent. The implementation of a shallow comparison of props and state in PureCounterComponent helps avoid unnecessary re-renders, leading to improved performance in scenarios where the component frequently re-renders but its props or state haven't changed.

Therefore, in terms of performance, PureCounterComponent is the preferred choice over SimpleCounterComponent.
